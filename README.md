Project Overview

This project serves as the final assignment for the Python module, focusing on analyzing employee data sourced from ABC company. The project encompasses various stages such as preprocessing, analysis, graphical representations, and deriving insights from the dataset.

Preprocessing Steps

Rectified missing data in the "Height" column by substituting it with randomly generated numbers ranging from 150 to 180.
Ensured the dataset's overall data consistency and integrity.
Analysis Tasks

Analyzed the distribution of employees across different teams, calculating the percentage split concerning the total workforce.
Classified employees based on their respective positions within the company.
Determined the predominant age group among employees.
Identified the teams and positions with the highest salary expenditures.
Explored the correlation between employees' age and their corresponding salaries, visually representing the findings.
Graphical Representations

Visualized employee distribution across teams using a bar chart.
Utilized a pie chart to illustrate the segregation of employees based on positions.
Employed a histogram to showcase the age distribution of employees.
Presented salary expenditure across teams and positions through bar charts.
Illustrated the correlation between age and salary using a scatter plot.

Additional Information

The project's implementation leveraged the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook for code organization.
The dataset used in this project is accessible within the repository under the filename "myexcel - myexcel.csv.csv".
